# REST Countries Browser
This is a web-based browser built with React that allows users to search for countries using the REST Countries API. The browser includes features to view detailed information about a country, as well as toggle between light and dark modes.

# Live demo
Look the live version in Vercel https://spa-countrys-using-api.vercel.app

# Usage
To use the REST Countries Browser, simply enter a search term into the search bar to see a list of countries matching that term. You can search by country name, capital city, or ISO code. You can also click on a country from the list to see detailed information about that country, including its flag, population, languages, and more.

The REST Countries Browser is a single page application, meaning that it does not require page refreshes to navigate between different views. Instead, the browser uses React to dynamically render views based on user input.

The browser also includes a toggle switch to switch between light and dark modes. This allows users to choose the mode that is most comfortable for them, regardless of their environment or device.

# API
The REST Countries Browser uses the REST Countries API to provide country data. This API provides a wide range of information about each country, including its name, capital city, population, languages, currencies, and more.

The browser uses the API to fetch data in real-time based on user input, allowing users to search for countries quickly and easily.
